# Openapi_spec

**WARNING:** You should not use this library directly, except through the OpenAPI V3 tool.
The schemas are not versioned and may change abruptly to enable new functionality in the
tool.

These are spec definitions for the [OpenAPI V3.0.3 spec](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3)
generated by copy pasting the entire OpenAPI spec into Claude V2 on 2023-07-17. Claude made
a lot of mistakes, so many things were fixed manually and adapted to a more Jane Street-y
style. It was then mostly rewritten by hand to make some things type safe. It turns out
Claude isn't that good yet.

The current latest version of the OpenAPI spec is V3.1.0, but this has breaking changes
with respect to V3.0.3. We would have used V3.1.0 if a good open-source converter from
V3.0.3 to V3.1.0 existed, but there does not seem to be one. Practically, the few OpenAPI
specs we looked at all seem to be in V3.0.X format.

If this is the future and you have come across a V3.1.0 spec, you will either need to
downgrade it or write an upgrade tool for V3.0.X -> V3.1.0 and change this to represent
the V3.1.0 schema.
