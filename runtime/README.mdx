# Openapi_runtime

Libraries generated by the OpenAPI generator need some functions in common, all of
which live here.

## Path_template

This module provides a `Path_template.t` abstraction which represents a HTTP URL path
in terms of a list of segments, some of which require user input to fully resolve.

## Tagged_object

The JSON Serialization / Deserialization logic needs access to the tags, which this
module can help add or remove from a given JSON object.

## Jane_with_json

These are versions of various useful types that have JSON serialization and
deserialization logic built in.
