# Openapi_codegen_ir

This part of the OpenAPI library contains various tools to map constructs in the
OpenAPI specification into OCaml constructs.


## Methods / Parameters / Responses

These modules take the parsed OpenAPI spec and convert it to an intermediate 
representation that contains information relevant to the generation of OCaml code.
They collapse all the references present in the spec, deduplicate them, and
give you a single `Operation_method.t` for purposes of building a function.

These modules are heavily inspired by the
[Progenitor](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/progenitor) Rust crate because the
crate is well built and seems to work on a wide variety of specs. If you're adding a new
feature to this, you should read `progenitor-impl/src/method.rs` first to see if Oxide
did it.

## Typify

Typify converts JSON Schema to OCaml types. It's heavily inspired by the
[Rust crate with the same name](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/typify).

A type space stores information about all the types used in the JSON Schema, such as
their shape and how they relate to each other. If something else in Jane Street ever
needs to parse JSON Schemas, you could break this file out into its own library with
more robust inference.

### Built-in types

In JSON Schema, types are defined by `type` and `format`. The below table maps
`type` and `format` to OCaml type. JSON Schema has unsigned integer types but
OCaml does not (except in `Stdlib`, but we use `Core`, so...), so we give up and hope
that the unsigned integer fits in a regular `int` (63 bit OCaml integer).

Some types are unimplemented simply because we haven't needed them yet. You can find
the rest [on the JSON Schema website](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html).

- `integer`/`int64` -> `Int64.t`
- `integer`/`*` -> `int`
- `number`/`double` -> `float`
- `boolean`/`*` -> `bool`
- `string`/`ip` -> `Ipaddr_jane.t`
- `string`/`ipv4` -> `Ipaddr_jane.V4.t`
- `string`/`ipv6` -> `Ipaddr_jane.V6.t`
- `string`/`uuid` -> `Uuid.t`
- `string`/`*` (with a specific value) -> `unit`
- `string`/`*` -> `string`

### Arrays

JSON Schema arrays intuitively turn into `'a list`s in OCaml.

### Objects

Objects turn in to OCaml record types wrapped in an OCaml module.

### OneOf

The OneOf construct maps to a OCaml variant type, with each variant being
`of` whatever the type of the variant is.

### AnyOf / AllOf

The anyOf and allOf constructs are tricky to handle in OCaml, so Typify hopes that they
only have one element inside them. If so, it passes through the type of the one underlying
element. Otherwise, it gives up and returns `Jsonaf.t`
