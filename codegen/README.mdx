# Openapi_codegen

This module handles converting a parsed OpenAPI specification from `Openapi_spec` into
an intermediate representation (`Openapi_codegen_ir`) and then into actual OCaml code.

## Usage

You likely do not want to use this module directly. See `Openapi_cli` instead to generate
OCaml code from an OpenAPI specification.

## Why templates?

The first thing I wanted to do was iteratively build up an OCaml AST and then recurse
over the AST to generate OCaml. Unfortunately, there are not that many weeks in an 
intern project, so to save a day or two this project uses templates. Someday we can rewrite
the backend to generate an AST instead.
